IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
COUNTY OF NEW YORK

MARY PETERSEN,
Plaintiff,

v.

JOHN DOE,
Defendant.

---------------------------------------------------------------

BRIEF FOR THE PLAINTIFF

I. FORWARD

This brief is submitted on behalf of Mary Petersen, the plaintiff, who brings this action against John Doe, the defendant, for the tortious sale of her personally identifiable information (PII) on the dark web. The plaintiff seeks compensation for the damages suffered as a result of the defendant's actions and requests injunctive relief to prevent further dissemination of her PII.

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Mary Petersen, a renowned Catholic philanthropist residing in New York City, has dedicated her life to charitable endeavors. However, her privacy was violated when her PII, including social security number, address, and financial records, were unlawfully acquired and subsequently sold on the dark web. This sale of sensitive information exposed Ms. Petersen to various risks, including identity theft, harassment, and reputational damage.

III. LEGAL ARGUMENTS

A. Breach of Privacy

1. Duty of Care: The defendant's sale of Ms. Petersen's PII constitutes a breach of the duty of care owed to her. The defendant's actions facilitated the unauthorized dissemination of private information, thereby violating Ms. Petersen's reasonable expectation of privacy.

2. Negligence: The defendant's conduct fell below the reasonable standard of care expected in handling confidential information. By failing to implement adequate security measures to safeguard Ms. Petersen's PII, the defendant acted negligently, leading to the harm suffered by the plaintiff.

B. Violation of Consumer Protection Laws

1. Unfair and Deceptive Practices: The defendant's sale of Ms. Petersen's PII on the dark web constitutes an unfair and deceptive trade practice. The defendant intentionally engaged in fraudulent activity by unlawfully obtaining and monetizing private information, which is prohibited under consumer protection laws.

2. Violation of Privacy Statutes: The defendant's actions also contravene state and federal privacy statutes that protect individuals' personal information. The sale of PII without consent, especially on the dark web, is expressly prohibited under these statutes.

C. Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress

1. Extreme and Outrageous Conduct: The defendant's intentional sale of Ms. Petersen's PII, knowing the potential harm it could cause, constitutes extreme and outrageous conduct.

2. Severe Emotional Distress: As a direct result of the defendant's actions, Ms. Petersen has suffered severe emotional distress, including anxiety, fear, and humiliation. The defendant should be held accountable for the emotional harm inflicted upon the plaintiff.

IV. DAMAGES AND RELIEF SOUGHT

A. Compensatory Damages

1. Economic Damages: Ms. Petersen seeks compensation for the financial losses incurred as a result of the defendant's

 actions, including costs related to identity theft protection, credit monitoring, and any direct monetary losses stemming from the unauthorized use of her PII.

2. Non-Economic Damages: The plaintiff also seeks damages for the non-economic harm suffered, such as emotional distress, reputational damage, and loss of enjoyment of life.

B. Punitive Damages

Given the intentional and malicious nature of the defendant's conduct, the plaintiff requests an award of punitive damages to punish the defendant and deter similar conduct in the future.

C. Injunctive Relief

Ms. Petersen seeks injunctive relief to prevent further dissemination of her PII. This includes an order prohibiting the defendant from selling, distributing, or otherwise using her personal information and requiring the defendant to delete any stored copies of the plaintiff's PII.

V. CONCLUSION

Mary Petersen, a philanthropist and victim of the defendant's malicious actions, seeks redress for the harm she has suffered as a result of the sale of her personally identifiable information on the dark web. The plaintiff's claims of breach of privacy, violation of consumer protection laws, and intentional infliction of emotional distress merit compensation and injunctive relief. The court should hold the defendant accountable for his actions and provide the necessary remedies to restore Ms. Petersen's privacy and compensate her for the damages incurred.
